    <p><h2>LEARN PYTHON DEVELOPMENT AND BECOME A SEMI-PRO IN THE YEAR 2025 EVEN AS A SOLO DEVELOPER.</h2></p>
    <P>Here are some things I did and learned while starting my career as a Python developer in 2024.
        Before I started Python development, there was that kind of feeling in me that Python woul require time and can't be learnt alone as a solo developer. So that was my mindset till I started to believe in myself and accept the fact that I can acheieve anything I could dream of.
        So, here is how it all started.
    </P> <p><b><h2>WHAT IS PYTHON?</h2></b></p>
    <p><b>Python </b>is a popular programming language. It was created by <a href="/">Guido Van Rossum</a>, and released in 1991. It was used for: Web Development(server-side), Software Development, Mathematics, System Scripting.</p>
    <p><h2><b>WHAT CAN PYHTON DO?</b></h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
            <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
            <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping or for production-ready software development.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><h2><b>WHY PYTHON?</b></h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Python works on different platforms(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry, Pi, etc).</li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
            <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that Prototyping can be very quick.</li>
            <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functinal way.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><h2><b>PYTHON SYNTAX COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.</b></h2></p>
    <P>
        <ol>
            <li>Python was designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semi-colons or paranthesis.</li>
            <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope, such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.</li>
        </ol>
    </P>
    <p><h2>Example:</h2></p>
    <p><ul><li>print("Hello World!")</li></ul></p>
    <p>prints the word <b>Hello World!</b> as output.</p>
    <p><img src="./img/python2.jpg" alt="Python2" width="100%"></p>
    <P>Or by creating a Python file on the server, using the <b>.py</b> file extension, and running it in the command line: <b>C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py</b></P>
    <p><h2>PYTHON INDENTATION</h2></p>
    <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
    <p><h2>Example:</h2></p> <p><ul><li>if 5 > 2 :</li> <li>print("Five is greater than two!")</li></ul></p>
    <p><h2>PYTHON VARIABLES</h2></p><p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:</p>
    <p><h2>Example:</h2> Variables in Python:</p><p>x = 5</p><p>y = "Hello, World!"</p><p><h2>COMMENTS</h2></p><p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation. Comments starts with a <b>#</b>, and Python will render the rest of the lines as a comment:</p>
    <p><h2>Example:</h2> Comments in Python:</p><p><ul><li># This is a comment. print("Hello, World!")</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</li><li>Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</li><li>Comment can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</li></ul></p>
